## Community Vision and Position

### Letter to Developer Partners

Dear Fellow Warriors:

Welcome to this growth-oriented community built by independent game developers!

Here, we don't have one-way "mentors," only partners fighting side by side.
We don't pursue massive course accumulation but focus on real project co-creation.

**Our Iron Triangle Positioning:**

- Growth Sandbox: Drive skill evolution through real game projects
- Mutual Aid Alliance: Developer resource sharing and experience inheritance network
- Co-creation Laboratory: Open-source toolchain + joint development testing ground

**[Core Proposition]** Through the "**Learn-Do-Teach**" cycle, enable every member to transform from **Newcomer → Contributor → Navigator**.

## Community Evolution Blueprint

### Short-term Goals (2025)

- Establish developer capability certification system (skill tree badge system)
- Launch 3 open-source collaboration projects (including 1 teaching DEMO + 2 Godot plugins)
- Incubate first GameJam winning works on itch.io

### Mid-term Goals (2026)

- Form sustainable community development fund (10% of current annual income allocated)
- Build cross-platform development resource library (Bilibili tutorials + GitHub toolchain + QQ channel knowledge base)
- Establish developer work publication support channel

### Long-term Vision

Build a decentralized developer ecosystem, enabling 1000 core members to have:

- Ability to continuously produce quality content
- Channels to obtain economic returns through collaboration
- Collective voice to influence industry development
